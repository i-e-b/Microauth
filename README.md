# Microauth
A very small OAuth2 server for testing
This works with OpenIdConnect flows, specifically based around the Okta commercial provider.
(mostly because they don't provide any reasonable test harnesses)

This should be treated as a basis for your test set-up.
There is no guarantee it will work out-of-the-box.

DO NOT EVER use this for production security. It is a test tool.
